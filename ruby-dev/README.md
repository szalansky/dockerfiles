# ruby-dev image

This image contains all necessary dependencies for modern Ruby applications.

It comes with latest Ruby version (speaking of July 2014 it's 2.1.2). You shouldn't have problems with installing **capybara** or other fussy eaters.

Build the image, write Dockerfile for your app, run the container and have fun!
